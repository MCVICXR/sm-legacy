				<h2>Preface: Welcome to the Record Project</h2>
			<article>
				<p>Over the last few years, I've inherited a lot of vinyl. I went from having one milk crate full of stuff that I mostly knew to five milk crates and one of those old green bins that the recycling used to get picked up in full of records. I wasn't very choosy about what was given to me and I didn't sort through any of it before I accepted it. I've barely listened to any of it. Vinyl is also surprisingly heavy and takes up a lot of space. I keep on having to move it and it's become a real pain in the ass.</p>

				<p>I find myself in this position because in 2006 three things happened: I had come up on a pair of barely functioning record players, I quit playing drums, and Tower Records went out of business. Vinyl samples on underground hip-hop beats had drawn my attention to the antiquated black platters. Finding the old record players was like striking gold for me. They barely worked, but I was hyped on 'em. They gave me a chance to try and make beats like the ones I had become so enamored with at the time. I had also recently quit playing drums, which I wasn't really serious about, but I was sort of bummed to not have a musical outlet anymore. Finding the record players filled that void. Now I just had to get my hands on some actual records, and rumor was that vinyl was <i>expensive</i>. I had some money in my pocket from washing dishes every weekend, but damn, not that much. On August 20<sup>th</sup>, 2006, Tower Records kindly obliged me by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and liquidation. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Records#mediaviewer/File:Tower_Records_3.jpg" target="blank" id="delta">They were selling CDs for dollars and vinyl for quarters</a>. I went buck, blew all my cash, and left with a tower of CDs and stack of records from Tower Records. lol.</p> 

				<p>I also got some records from an old co-worker friend of mine from my coffee making days. He gave me a bunch of cool shit like Pink Floyd, Tupac, and Outkast. Records came from other places and other people, but exactly from where and who I don't remember. I did a pretty good job a keeping the vinyl collection at a reasonable size for a number of years. Then I inherited a ridiculous amount when my grandma had to move out of her home. They're old and dusty and heavy and dammit I have to figure out what to do with it all. So here we go. The plan is to listen to all records. There are many of them. I don't know what most of them even are. Some of them are still wrapped in plastic. I know that some of them are classics I'll never give up. Some I'm sure will be used to perfect my sweet ultimate frisbee moves. Some might even be worth some money. There are too many records to write about each and every one, so I'll only be mentioning the notable and the notorious, and the needless will merely be listed as either staying or going.</p>

				<p>Here Are The Rules For Me Doing This:
					<br />
					1. Every record has to be listened to. That includes 'The Carpenters' albums.
					<br />
					2. Try and do one post for this project a week.
					<br />
					3. Just get it done.
