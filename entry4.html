				<h2>Entry 4: Sometimes Things Go Wrong</h2>
				<p>They say you have to know the rules in order to break them properly. Only a couple weeks in and I’ve managed to break one of my own rules: post once a week. I haven’t put anything up for about twenty days. The rebel streak continues, non-existent consequences be damned.</p> 
				<p>Doing this isn’t exactly easy. Listening to a bunch of records, many of which are just really, really bad, is not always the most fun thing when I could be playing cool beats that I found on Soundcloud, or really any other kind of music when I work. There have been a few times when I’ve wondered if I should just keep the titles that I’m familiar with and toss the rest. But so far I’ve resisted the temptation to do so, mostly because I started this and would like to finish it and just have the records I care about so I can do something like this:</p>

				<p>Sort of like how a CD player uses a small laser to read lines of information on a spinning disk, a record player uses what’s called a stylus (I refer to it colloquially as a needle) to get sound from the grooves on a spinning vinyl record. Needles tend to break after a certain period, and the one on my record player broke a few weeks ago. The place where I used to buy replacements, <a href="http://www.roosiehood.com/2010/10/jns-phonograph-needles-closes-its-doors/" id="delta">JnS</a>, closed its doors back in 2010 to make way for a new light rail station. Until recently, I haven’t had the need to buy any new phonograph equipment so tracking down a new needle was a small chore.</p>
				<p>What’s actually important though, is what was happening when the needle broke. There’s this big pile of records that I got from my grandma that are probably from the 1930’s. They didn’t put copyright dates on older records so I’m left to making an educated guess. These particular records are stiff and much heavier in their physical composition. I soon discover that they definitely weren’t made to be used with my record player. When played, they produced audio of very low fidelity. I tried out a few of the records that were like this and got the same, unlistenable results each time. Unfortunately, one of these tests broke the needle. I think it was a case of components not meant to work with each other being exerted improperly for just a little too long. The needle was already worn, and it finally crapped out on me.</p>
				<p>While breaking needle was an annoying, $20 curveball, one that was ultimately remedied by a Google query and an Amazon purchase, it did help me discover that I could get rid of an entire crate of records without listening to all of them. Hooray! I don’t know about you, but I'm excited to continue this obscure journey without having to plunge too deep into the rabbit hole. See you all next week for Entry 5.</p>
