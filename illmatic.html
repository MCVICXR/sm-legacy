				<h2>Entry 3:</h2>
				<img src="images/illmatic.png" class="illmatic" alt="illmatic">
				<p>Nas’ Illmatic had its 20th anniversary a little over a year ago, and everyone and anyone wrote about it. All you have to do is google ‘illmatic 20th anniversary’ and you get countless hits on articles explaining JUST HOW GOOD ILLMATIC IS OMG. Everyone that would be interested in reading an article about Illmatic already knows how good it is. We all know it's good. And what’s the point of writing five hundred words on your own interpretation of the album when websites like Rap Genius have already decided for us what these lyrics mean? To quote another New York rapper, “That shit is played out.”</p> 
				<p>Don’t get me wrong, Illmatic is an indubitable masterpiece. It should be inducted to the Library of Congress, and at some point beamed out into space on a never-ending signal, looped on repeat like it used to be on my iPod, and along with it a thought-piece written by a blogger explaining to some space alien how they’re supposed to feel about it with a link to a lyrics website that hashes out the minutiae of cultural references to a point where it becomes an exercise in rhetoric studies where nothing is left to the imagination.</p>
				<p>I think there’s an inherent dichotomous nature in listening to music; you want to be isolated at times to properly absorb what you’re hearing without distraction, but the flip side of that is wanting to socialize so you can tell whoever how great or terrible whatever it is you just heard is, and maybe why it made you feel the way it did and what you though it was about. You purposely enter this arena of social discourse to throw your thoughts and opinions against someone else’s to possibly sharpen, alter, or even repeal your own. I suppose I feel now like our opinions are being written for us, telling us what to think and feel from everything from music, to books, to episodes of TV shows. I suppose by writing what I write on this site I’m guilty of it myself. But when something like Illmatic is put through the wringer and over-analyzed so many times it begins to lose its magic. </p>

				<p>What is magic exactly? It’s those faint memories that tracks one thru ten conjure up after the play button is pushed. It’s when a guy named Chandler told me that I had to hear this record. It’s when the beat and those words hit me and suddenly the album became the soundtrack to my life, and it felt like sometimes it was the only thing getting me through the day. It’s sharing that same music with other people, my friends, my brother, my girlfriend and my parents, knowing that it might not do the same thing for them that it did for you, but you still want them to experience it. When my friend Ryan brought me back a vinyl copy of Illmatic when he moved back to Seattle after college, it was like this event set into motion years before had come full circle. </p>
				<p>The truth is I don’t really listen to Illmatic anymore, at least not on the daily basis that I used to, and the only reason I’m spending time writing about it is because it’s a record in my collection that merits some sort of recognition. I’ve heard a few interviews with Nas where he gets asked about Illmatic and he just sounds burned out talking about it, like there’s this voice in his head saying, “Ok, don’t these people have anything else to ask me about?” As previously displayed by yours truly a paragraph ago, every hip-hop fan boy that has listened to Illmatic has some very special memories tied to it, but damn, after writing six hundred words on this, it’s like there’s this voice in my head saying, “Ok, don’t you have anything else to write about?” At the end of the day, it doesn't matter why I think it's good or how I interpret a certain verse or song. It just matters that people get to listen to this album at least one time and vibe to it.</p>
				<p>Verdict: Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind.</p>
