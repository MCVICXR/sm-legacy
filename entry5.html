				<h2>Entry 5: On Hiatus Forever</h2>
				<p>
					It's summer. It's almost been two months since my last entry. I'm not keeping up with this and during this time of year, I don't really want to. Right now it's  possible to drink a beer outside, at night, while wearing shorts and sandals. Priorities.
				</p>
			
				<p>
					I still haven't bought replacement parts for my record player. I probably never will. This isn't a hobby I wanted to drain my wallet, especially when the vast majority of the records in this collection I inherited are just real, real bad. I don't want to keep writing post after post about how shitty some unheard of album from 1963 was. Seems silly. And not to sound conceited, but writing about music feels sort of juvenile. At least it does to me now.
				</p>

				<p>
					I've also come to this realization: while I do love to write, I don't enjoy writing in this format. "Blogging" feels like an overly repetitious practice, tied up with too much cynicism, unsolicited opinion, and continous, unending outrage about something.  
				</p>

				<p>
					This was a fun little experiment, but it's time to call it quits. There's other stuff, although larger in scope and harder to do, that I would rather spend my time on.
