				<h2>Surviving the Rodeo Tour with Travi$ Scott and Yung Thug</h2>
			<article>
				<p>Ever find yourself in a situation and wonder, "Am I getting too old for this shit?" I&#39;ve found that this question usually comes along during inopportune moments; on the field during the middle of a game or standing in line to get into someplace you hope doesn't suck, things that you can't usually immediately disengage from. Mosh pits at concerts are another example. Getting into a mosh pit is easy. Getting out of one is a feat of endurance, good timing, tempered aggression, and a whole lot of luck.</p>

				<p>It&#39;s been a few years, but I've been to some rock concerts (Metallica, Deftones, Rammstein and new-lead-singer Alice in Chains to list a few), so it's not like I've never been stuck in a crowd, drenched not only in my sweat but also the sweat of my new fifty best friends, and also partially fighting for survival all while trying to enjoy a show. However, I've also been to a few rap shows. While they were usually energetic, they were nothing like any of the rock concerts that I luckily escaped from unscathed.</p> 

				<p>Travi$ Scott and Yung Thug have been getting consistent play on whatever it is I'm listening to music on for a while. I'm a fan. Some of my friends are fans. When we found out that the Rodeo Tour was coming to town, tickets were bought quickly and months in advance. The excitement had plenty of time to build. As La Flame and Thug did shows in other cities prior to their Seattle engagement, shaky videos captured at their concerts started to surface on social media. What I saw surprised me. It wasn't a rap show where people nodded their head and bobbed their hands in the air. What I would eventually come to experience at the Rodeo Tour was just a familiar beast that I hadn&#39;t seen for awhile, one that had changed its appearance but not its behavior.</p>

				<p>The concert was amazing. Yung Thug and Travi$ traded off songs and mixed up the crowd energy, taking things up then back down again. It wasn&#39;t always a continuous rager. There were some more relaxed songs dispersed throughout the set. Thugger might be the more talented performer, but La Flame lives up to his name and his music in the way he commands the crowd to do his bidding. When he wanted the crowd to go hard they obeyed. Myself included. Before the show, I joked with my buddy about maybe getting a little rowdy at the show, as I was expecting to just watch from the back. But La Flame had none of that. Mosh pits happened everywhere, in front of the stage, in the back by the bathroom, and off to the side by the merch table. La Flame, Thugger and the young, talented producer/DJ Metro Boomin sent shockwaves into the crowd. They turned a hip hop show into a rock concert. It was impossible to escape. But no one at this show wanted to.</p>

				<p>Everyone at this show bought in and threw down. At one point I was panting, fighting dehydration and sore knees and stuck in a massive, throbbing all-ages crowd and that question poked out its ugly head, &#34;Am I getting too old for this shit?&#34; Then <a href="https://soundcloud.com/travisscott-2/dont-play" id="delta">my very favorite song</a> came on, and despite my earlier reservations, I suddenly found myself in a reinvigorated mosh pit. It was Asian kids, black kids, white kids, punk rockers, stoners, molly-heads, nerds and everyone else smiling and screaming back the chorus as they collided into each other. In that moment nothing else mattered and it was incredible to see. Yeah, I&#39;m probably getting to old for this shit, but I&#39;d deal with some sore knees and a headache to experience the Rodeo Tour again.</p>
